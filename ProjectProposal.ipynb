    "### Background and Prior Work (K)\n",
    "\n",
    "The group’s intent to investigate cities with varying housing market prices and relating this variable to police citation density provides the opportunity to discover the economic and social implications of how consumers populate certain regions. Throughout this project, we are attempting to work with multiple cities with differing housing economies to create a correlation between a city’s housing market and the its police citation density. House buyer sentiment of a city arrives at many factors that influence the price they are willing to pay for a house in the region. We believe crime to be an under looked yet imperative indicator of buyer sentiment. The assumption that we took with regards to housing prices within cities is that houses will positively correlate and increase in value with more amenities and features the house provides. A factor like crime poses as a cost to the community and is portrayed as an indirect effect to the region’s housing economy. Severity of crime is also a point of interest we intend to examine in hopes of discriminating categories of crime that are most influential to housing market prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon further research and understanding of our context, it was clear that the projected needed to create a price model that distinguished between other features and provide quantitative data to the effect a house’s price has on the region’s crime statistics. The first reference managed to utilize an index of public safety alongside the primary features and held a firm precaution against utilizing a measure of the number of crimes as this measure places the same value on all types of crimes. As, stated earlier, it is imperative for us to assign weights to each category so that the model can provide reliable output. This first reference suggests that areas with high and low crimes (the opposite extremes of our data set) affect the price of local houses dramatically. The secondary reference is a data science project vital to the understanding of our investigation and provides the foundation for us to utilize and test methodologies. This reference serves as a model for our project so that we can have the opportunity to discover new insights our features can point toward during each step of the process.\n",

    "The housing data from zillow is well defined, however, we would want to check all pricing values for possible numerical errors such as if the price is zero or any \"inf\" or \"na\" values. We would also need to check the locaiton data to ensure there are no blank values. The location data in the police citation datasets are not properly formatted consistently and will need to be replaces with values comparable to the Zillow housing data sets.\n",

    "The Zillow housing data comes with a lot of extraneous information that would need to be trimmed out. We would first want to determine which location set of data would be most useful for matching with the police citation data. Since both datasets do not contain the same type of location identifiers, we would need to transform the location identifiers to a universal set of data that could be compared between different data sets. Some preprocessing may also be needed for the locations to separate them into area units that fit to the number of citations per area. \n",

    "For the police data we would need to get the number of counts for each citation and the aggregate sum for each unit area determined by housing district. The police citations may further be categorized into severity based on the citation to be compared to the average price of the houses in that area. We would then determine the correlation between housing prices and the number of citations in each district. Ideally, this would help us determine if there is a relationship between housing prices and citations given in each area. \n",
